# 📊 Data Analysis Bootcamp – Python Projects

This repository contains **mini and major projects** developed as part of my learning journey during the **Data Analysis Bootcamp**.  
Each project helped me improve my skills in Python, logic building, database integration, and building real-world console applications.

## 🔐 1. Password Checker / Login System (Mini Project)

A simple simulation of a password setting and login system using basic Python concepts.

### 📚 What I Learned
- Python Basics
- Conditional Statements (`if`, `else`, `elif`)
- Loops (`while`)
- String comparison
- User input handling
- Basic login logic

### 🚀 How It Works
- User sets a password  
- Program gives 3 chances to enter the correct password  
- If correct, user is logged in  
- If failed all 3 times, login is blocked  
- Option to view forgotten password

### 💻 Tech Used
- Python (Pure Core)
- Terminal/Command line input/output

### 🧠 Future Improvements
- Hide password input (`getpass`)
- Password strength checker
- Store password in file or database
